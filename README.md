# Delmod V.2.0
7 Days To Die Mods

- - - - Delmod A18 Modlet Collection - - - - 

This is currently a set of modlets that I threw together for A17 and have updated and added to for A18.  The usual disclaimers and rules apply. 

I created this for my own personal use for me and my friends.  These Modlets are very much "works in progress" and will be updated and/or improved and added to as my time allows and as I am able. Of course, additions. corrections, and suggestions are ALWAYS welcome. 

I would like to credit the following individuals  right now: sphereii, Guppycur, stedman420, KhaineGB, stallionsden, and others for code examples, tutorials, etc. If you are not credited here it is because I can not remember what I used of yours. If you feel I have used something of yours and yuou would like credit please contact me.  I am sure I will credit more people here as time goes on.  

These all currently work in Single Player and MultiPlayer mode.   
If the Modlet needs to be installed on the client as well as the server I have noted that by each title.  S means Server only  S/C means server AND client.
